# Workshop 1: Introducing JavaScript with P5.js

Collaborators: [your github username] & [your partners github username]

Make sure you‚Äôre working in pairs - on a single laptop. You‚Äôll be **pair
programming**. In pair programming, there are two roles - **driver** and
**navigator**.

The **driver** is at the keyboard. They‚Äôre responsible for typing and figuring
out syntax. They shouldn‚Äôt make decisions though! That‚Äôs the responsibility of
the **navigator**. They make decisions, and ask the driver to implement them.

Start by forking this repo:
![fork button](https://readme-pics.s3.amazonaws.com/fork_button.jpg)

Forking creates a copy of this repo in your own GitHub account. Add your partner
as a collaborator by going to 'Settings' > 'Collaborators & teams' and entering
their GitHub username in the 'Collaborators' box. That means you'll both have
access to the repo.

You should now have a copy of this git repository in your own github account.
Now, we need to get a copy on our own laptop for us to work with. Start by
opening a terminal and creating a projects/ada folder if you don't already have
one:

```sh
cd Desktop
mkdir Projects
cd Projects
```

Next, we need to clone the repo. This copies all the files and history from
github to our own computer:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your github username>/di-workshop-01-intro-to-p5.git
cd di-workshop-01-intro-to-p5
```

You can see that it's a git repository and some of the history by running these
commands:

```sh
git status
git log
```

> **Note:** If you get stuck in `git log`, it's because you're in something
> called a pager. This is a really old bit of software from before computers
> could scroll in the way we're used to. You can move up and down in the pager
> with your arrow keys, and exit it by pressing `q`

Finally, we need to install some bits and pieces that in our new repo to finish
setting it up:

```sh
npm install
```

---

We‚Äôll be working with some software called P5. P5 is a **JavaScript library**
for drawing shapes - it‚Äôs used for making simple games and cool generative art.

For each of the **bold** questions below:

<h3 align="center">
  üó£ Discuss &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  üë©‚Äçüíª Change &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  üëÄ Observe &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  üîÑ Repeat
</h3>

1. **üó£ Discuss** the question with your partner
1. **üë©‚Äçüíª Change the code** - what do you expect your changes to do?
1. **üëÄ Observe the results** - what happened when you ran your code? How did it
   differ from your expectations
1. **üîÑ Repeat** - keep discussing, changing, and running the code until you
   feel you understand it

**The aim of this workshop is _exploration_, hopefully leading to
_understanding_. It‚Äôs really important that you _take your time_. The questions
below are _guidelines_, meant to prompt your _curiosity_. If you can‚Äôt answer a
question, use a search engine or ask someone nearby. Don‚Äôt move on until you
_fully understand_ what‚Äôs happening.**

**Explore and have fun! Be curious!**

# Setup

Now you've got the repo cloned and installed, we need to start it up:

```sh
npm start
```

This runs a web server - a little program that your browser can connect to so
that the files you write in this project can run in there. Now, when you visit
http://localhost:5000/, you'll see all your files right there.

Open the workshop folder in your editor. In VSCode, choose File > Open and
select the folder - _not any of the files inside it_. You should see all the
workshop files in the left-hand file pane.

Open this file - README.md - in your editor. Make notes in here about everything
you do. If you don't know the answer to a question, it's your job to experiment
with the code to see what you can find out.

# Sketch A

Open the `part-a` sketch in your browser, and open `part-a/sketch.js` in your
editor. The code in `sketch.js` is what's running on the page. Every time you
make a change in `sketch.js`, you need to save the file (ctrl-S or cmd-S) and
refresh your web browser (ctrl-r or cmd-r) to see the change.

---

Look at these lines:

```js
var r = 255
var g = 80
var b = 0
```

**What might these lines do?**
They store information under each declared variable e.g. variable r = colour code 255
**What happens if you change the numbers?**
Changes the colour code assigned to the variable. It calls the background function, which uses the varaibles as parameters
**What numbers are allowed / What numbers have an effect?**
0-255
Look at this line:

```js
createCanvas(400, 400)
```

**What does createCanvas do?**
Creates a square with a pixel dimension of 400x400
**What happens if you change the numbers?**
Changes the size and shape of the square
**What numbers are allowed/what numbers have an effect?**
Only positive numbers
**What happens if you add/remove a number?**
The parameters width and height are required when declaring the createCanvas variable. If one of those parameters are to be removed, a default canvas is created 100px by 100px - but doesn't allow colour.

**Can you guess what the `function setup() {` part does? What happens if you
change the name of setup?**
The setup function is predefined in the P5 library and allows the browser to execute the functions stored within that library.

L ook at this line:

```js
background(r, g, b)
```

**What does background do?**
The background function takes the parameters (numbers) and sets the background colour for the shape we created with createCanvas function. Parameters are numbers between 0-255, we store them in r, g and b variables

**What happens if you change the order of the letters in background? What does
this tell you about how the computer uses them?**

It would change the colour of the shape. Function 'background' takes 3 parameters in the order: red, green and blue.

**What happens if you change the number of letters?**
It only retrieves information from the three parameters r, g and b. If anything else is declared it'll be ignored and an error/bug may occur 
**What happens if you change the letters for different ones?**
The function wont be called and an error will occur. We must declare the new variables to allow it to work.
# Sketch B

Open the `part-b` sketch in your browser, and open `part-b/sketch.js` in your
editor.

Read the code and play with the sketch in your browser.

> **Note**: There's two main sections in the code - the bit called `setup` and
> the bit called `draw`. The code in the `setup` section runs **once**, when
> your program first starts up. The code in the `draw` section runs again and
> again and again - 60 times every second.

Look at these lines:

```js
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400)
  background(0, 0, 0)
}
```

**What does setup do?**
The setup function retrieves information from the project files and declares the canvas size and the background colour of the canvas

**What do `{` `}` mean? What happens if you remove one?**
The { brackets limit the function. Removing one will not allow the code to be executed.

**What do the numbers in `background(0, 0, 0)` do? What happens when you change
them? How is this different from Sketch A?**

Now look at these lines:

```js
function draw() {
  fill(255, 0, 0)
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 30, 30)
}
```

**What does draw do?**
The draw function takes the information from the fill and ellipse variables. These variables produce a result of a 30x30 circles to be created in accordance with the position of the mouse. The circles are filled with the colour declared in the fill variable.
Now look at:

```js
fill(255, 0, 0)
```

**What do these numbers do? What happens when you change them?**
These numbers are rgb colour variables and inform the program to produce a particular colours based on the set parameters.
**What does fill mean? What happens if you change it to stroke?**
The fill variable infroms the program to fill the ellipses with the rgb colour 255, 0, 0. If changed to a 
storke variable then only the outline of function will change colour
**What happens if you remove (or comment out) this line? What about if you include both fill and stroke on seperate lines?**
If you include both fill and stroke variables then it allows the user to change the colour of both the outline and fill of the shape.
Now look at this line:

```js
ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 30, 30)
```

**What does `ellipse` do?**
It makes the draw function produce a circle.
**What happens if you change the numbers?**
The size of the ellipses produce changes in accordance with the size of the numbers
**What do `mouseX` and `mouseY` mean?**
These are declared variables that track the position of the mouse along x and y axis. 
**What happens if you change the order of the items between the `(` `)`?**

---

**What happens if you add `background(0)` after `draw() {`? Why?**
The program no longer fills the background of the canvas, meaning that the canvas can no longer be seen.

Replace the ellipse with a triangle. Use https://p5js.org/reference/ (the 2D
primitives section) to help.

Play around with the sketch - how else can you change it?

# Sketch C

Open the `part-c` sketch in your browser, and open `part-c/sketch.js` in your
editor.

Read the code, then play with the sketch and observe what happens - try clicking
the mouse on the sketch.

Look at:

```js
if (mouseIsPressed) {
  fill(255, 0, 0)
} else {
  fill(0, 255, 0)
}
```

**What does `mouseIsPressed` mean?**
The mouseIsPressed variable creates the instruction for the program to fill the ellipse with rgb(255, 0, 0) when the mouse is pressed. An if/else statement is used, meaning that when the mouse isn't pressed, the ellipse is filled with
rgb(0, 255, 0).
**What happens if you change `mouseIsPressed` to `keyIsPressed`?** You‚Äôll need
to click on the sketch so it registers keyboard events ‚Äì use the ctrl key if you
have issues with the keyboard.
The mouseIsPressed doesn't contain any information of the function, so nothing changes.
**What does if / else do?**
An if/else statement is used to determine whether an action should be taken, based on whether or not of the statement is true. The else part of the if/else statement creates an exception to the if statement, allowing for new actions to commence if the original statement is false.
**What happens if you remove the { } or ( )? Why?**
The parentheses contain the expressions which are to be executed if they are removed then the expressions cannont be executed so only a blank page is shown.
**What happens if you change 255 to mouseX ? Why?**
the 255 variable controls the width of the shape, it changed to mouseX then the width of the shape will be controlled by the mouses position on the X axis
**Remove the outline of the circle. Use Google and the P5.js reference to help
you.**

# Challenge

In your pairs, take the code in sketch c and adapt it into a simple paint
program. The user should be able

- click and drag to paint on the screen
- press keys on the keyboard to choose a colour
  - e.g. pressing ‚Äòr‚Äô changes the paint colour to red, pressing ‚Äòg‚Äô changes the
    paint colour to green.

Use this code as a starting point:

```js
if (keyIsPressed) {
  if (key == 'r') {
    // set paint colour to red
  }
  if (key == 'g') {
    // set paint colour to green
  }
  // add more keys/colours
}
```

**Document your process in this file.**

## Extension

- Change the shape of the brush (explore other shapes like squares or triangles)
  based on a key pressed
- Change the size of the brush based on a key pressed.
